# Raspberry PI Temperature with Watson IoT - Basic MQTT 

The goal of this project is to provide a very simple method of getting started with Watson IoT and an MQTT client using a real sensor.  I have selected a DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor given the simplicity of how to wire the solution.  Please follow the instructions to wire your DHT11 Temperature Sensor here:

Special thanks for the code already included in this repository that helps read the sensor values from the DHT11:

# Step 1:  Verify the DHT 11 is working properly

Run the following command to verify that you are receiving values:

'''console
python dht1_example.py
'''
